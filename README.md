## How the Project Works
This app takes a user input and converts it to another form of the same measurement but in a different system(mainly the US Customary to the SI System)
It first asks the user to make a choice of which conversion they would like to do, there are five options for different conversion: Pounds to Kilgorams, Feet to Yards(the only one that does not switch systems), Miles to Kilometers, Inches to Millimeters, and Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Then, it asks for a value for the orignial measurement. 
Finally, it prints out both the original measurement and the value of the coverted measurement. 
It asks the user for one more value, either 'again' or 'exit' to determine whether it will run the code again, or exit the app.
